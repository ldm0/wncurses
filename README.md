NCURSES in console of MS Windows.

Recently found that the ncurses is really convient for building beautiful programs in the form of command line.

However there is no a windows version.What I found now is only a uncomplete version: <http://github.com/justinmeza/wincurses>

If this is built up, It will be fairly easy to transfer some linux applications to the windows console application.

So I decided to build it(hopefully not to crap it).(18/8/23)
