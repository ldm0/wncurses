# wncurses
NCURSES in console of windows.

Recently found that the ncurses is really convient for building beautiful programs in the form of command line. 

However there is no a windows version.What I found now is only a uncomplete version: http://github.com/justinmeza/wincurses 

So I decided to build it(hopefully not to crap it).(18/8/23)
