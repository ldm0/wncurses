NCURSES library in MS command line.

### Functions implemented(132/330)

Recently found that the ncurses is really convient for building beautiful programs in the form of command line.

However there is no a windows version. What I found now is only a uncomplete version: <http://github.com/justinmeza/wincurses>

If this is built up, It will be fairly easy to transplant some linux applications to the windows console application.
